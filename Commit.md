- This project will soon be available for all to see and it will
be the last time I write pure CSS. I'll be using Tailwind CSS
next.
- A lot is still going on but I'm sure that in a few days the work will be done, there's a lot of difficulties, I just have to believe and you know how CSS is, I just have to focus and do what needs to be done.
- I'm currently working on it rn so it might be ready by Friday, but there might be updates in the future.
- Hello guys, it's been a while, the project has been delayed because I want rewrite it using Tailwindcss, atm one not been able to deploy anything, even a test page and I might be forced to use their CDN. See you later, have a nice day.
